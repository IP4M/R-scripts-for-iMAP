web server of IP4M
Metabolomics data analysis depends on the utilization of bioinformatics tools. To meet the evolving needs of metabolomics research, several integrated platforms have been developed. Our group has developed a desktop platform IP4M (integrated Platform for Metabolomics Data Analysis) which allows users to perform a nearly complete metabolomics data analysis in one-stop. With the extensive usage of IP4M, more and more demands were raised from users worldwide for a web version and a more flexible workflow. Thus, iMAP (integrated Metabolomics Analysis Platform) was developed with extended functions, improved performances, and redesigned structures. Compared with existing platforms, iMAP has more flexible workflows and more optional criteria for differential variables selection. A new module was developed with an automatic pipeline for train-test set separation, feature selection, and predictive model construction and validation. A new network module was incorporated with sufficient editable parameters for network construction, visualization, and analysis. Moreover, plenty of plotting tools have been upgraded for highly customized publication-ready figures. iMAP is freely available for academic usage at https://imap.metaboprofile.cloud/ (License MPL 2.0).
